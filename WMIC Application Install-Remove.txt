
Problem? You need to remove software from a remote machine and cannot get a desktop on the machine.

Solution

1.Use psexec from the PSTools suite to open a cmd session on the remote machine:
psexec.exe \\remote-machine cmd

2.Use wmic to find the exact name of the software:

"wmic product get name"  or  from another machine with cmd open as admin "wmic /NODE:"machine-name" product get" <cleaner

3.Once you know the name of the software, you can remove it with wmic as well:

wmic product where name="application name" call uninstall

If you know the name of the product you can just run with it.

wmic product where name="McAfee VirusScan Enterprise" call uninstall

wmic product where name="McAfee DLP Endpoint" call uninstall

wmic product where name="SiteAdvisor Enterprise Plus" call uninstall

c:\Program Files\McAfee\Common Framework\FrmInst.exe /forceuninstall
